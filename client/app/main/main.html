         <h1>About</h1>
          <p>"Express" established it's roots back in the mid 1950's with the oldest of the Dana Brothers and the group's leader, Frank Dana ( rhythm guitar, lead vocals, and falsetto), playing in the group "Rusty and the Rock-A-Tones."</p>

          <p>Mike Dana ( keyboards, falsetto, lead vocals and musical arranger) joined the "Rock-A-Tones" in 1957, at the age of 12 when they became the house band for St. Thomas Aquinas Church on Flatlands Avenue in Brooklyn. St. Thomas sponsored many of the 50's rock and roll shows where the "Rock-A-Tones" backed such groups as "Dion and the Belmonts", "The Passions", "The Mystics", and "The Dimensions", to name a few. In 1960 Frank Dana went into the service and the "Rock-A-Tones" disbanded.</p>

          <p>After joining the LIRR in 1967, he met Frank Sellers and formed a group called "Frank Sellers and the Coachmen", playing mostly country music, and some 50's and 60's. The group stayed together until 1981, when Rick Frase (sax and vocal bass) and Frank left to form "NiteOwl Express", playing mostly 50's and 60's music and some country. Mike Dana rejoined his brother's group in 1983, and the youngest of the Dana Brothers, Don (Lead vocals, 2nd tenor and 
          percussion), joined in 1985. Tony Orlando "NiteOwl 
          Express" drummer passed away in 1990, and Frankie B. (Frank Bell) became the group's drummer. After following the band for about a year, and being 
          featured as a guest singer, Eddie Diamond (lead doo-wop vocals) rounded out the group in 1993 at which time the groups name was shortened to 
          "Express." In 2004, Ricky Frase (sax, vocal bass) passed away. Approximately one year later, Richie B. became the groups sax player.</p>
